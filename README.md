# EcoAct Platform: Data-Driven Carbon Emissions Management

The EcoAct platform addresses the urgent need for businesses to manage their carbon emissions in a data-driven and impactful way. Developed to support companies on their journey to net zero, this platform enables users to calculate annual carbon emissions across scopes 1, 2, and 3, benchmark results against industry standards, and invest in high-quality carbon credits. Its object-oriented architecture ensures scalability and modifiability, incorporating features such as user-specific emissions data input, visualized reporting with Pandas and Matplotlib, and an integrated carbon credit marketplace.

This project was developed in **2024** and represents one of my foundational experiences with **object-oriented programming**. It taught me the essential need to effectively balance code complexity with user benefit when programming under resource constraints. By applying course concepts to the real-world sustainability problem, EcoAct became a useful business tool and lays a solid foundation for future enhancements.
